### Study Notes

#### CSS How CSS files should organized and structured in React apps?

#### CSS What's the best way to reset/normalize styles initially?

#### CSS `height` Property
- height: auto|length|initial|inherit;
- The height does not include padding, borders, or margins; it sets the height of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element!
- If height: auto; the element will automatically adjust its height to allow its content to be displayed correctly.
- If height is set to a numeric value (like pixels, (r)em, percentages) then if the content does not fit within the specified height, it will overflow. How the container will handle the overflowing content is defined by the overflow property.
