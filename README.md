# My Books App

## Project description

This application allows you to keep track of your own personal library. It includes a list of books that are already in your possession or those in your wishlist. Each of these books will be grouped in three _shelves_ depending on their status:

* Currently reading
* Want to read
* Read

You will be able to change a book status anytime, as well as add new titles to or remove items from your library.

## Installation and deployment

### Pre-requisites

In order to run this application, you must have [Node Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your system.

### Get the application running

# Install all project's dependencies
> npm install

# Run application's server
> npm start
```

If you are using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead, just replace `npm` with `yarn` in the commands listed above.

After running the `start` command, the console output should tell you at which URL is the application running.

```bash
The app is running at:

  # URL where the app is running
